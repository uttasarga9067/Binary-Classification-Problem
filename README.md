# Binary-Classification-Problem

## The Idea behind this Machine Learning Model was to build a Binary Classification Application using PySpark (Distributed Computing Python API) and MLLib Pipelines. The four Models that were built on the Bank Dataset were Logistic Regression Model, Decision Trees, Randmom Forest and Gradient Boosted Tree Algorithms.
## Gradient Boosted Tree algorithm performed best on the Data Set with around 89% Accuracy.
